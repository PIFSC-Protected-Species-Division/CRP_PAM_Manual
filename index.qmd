## Passive Acoustics Monitoring - Lab Manual

A key priority of the Passive Acoustic Monitoring - Strategic Initiative (PAM-SI) is to build an open science culture across the agency by leveraging GitHub as a collaboration, coordination, and project management tool. To achieve this we have developed national and regional lab manuals that follow a parallel structure and link to each other. These manuals will serve as the primary storage location for all lab related information, including methods and data management, and will be a single access resource to support coordination across science center PAM programs.
