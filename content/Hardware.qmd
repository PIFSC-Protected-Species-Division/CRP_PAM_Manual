[![Schematic showing typical glider operation. The glider descends from the surface to 1000 m and then ascends back to the surface. It records acoustic data files while underwater, picking up sounds of things like echolocating beaked whales. At the surface it calls a base station using satellite communications to transmit data and receive new commands.

## HARP: High-Frequency Acoustic Recording Package

A hardware section is required and should include the following information;

-   Information on your recorders
-   Array configurations and diagrams
-   Platform information (towed, moored, drifting, etc.)
-   Other sensors included (GPS devices, depth senors, etc.)

This will be variable for each center and may change from project to project. You should list all hardware, present and past.

You can also link to a separate hardware repository if needed ([SAEL example](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/SAEL-lab-manual/content/Hardware_ADRIFT.html))

This can be a section with subpages or a qmd
