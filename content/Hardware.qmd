NOAA Fisheries collects passive acoustic monitoring data through a variety of instruments. Below are the types of instruments used by the Cetacean Research Program.

## Towed Array

[![Schematic showing typical glider operation. The glider descends from the surface to 1000 m and then ascends back to the surface. It records acoustic data files while underwater, picking up sounds of things like echolocating beaked whales. At the surface it calls a base station using satellite communications to transmit data and receive new commands.
