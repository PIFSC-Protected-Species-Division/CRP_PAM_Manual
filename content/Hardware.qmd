[![Schematic showing typical glider operation. The glider descends from the surface to 1000 m and then ascends back to the surface. It records acoustic data files while underwater, picking up sounds of things like echolocating beaked whales. At the surface it calls a base station using satellite communications to transmit data and receive new commands.
